# Smart-Contract-Account-Book

## Project Overview

Combining the basic concept of smart contract and Ethereum introduced on lecture four and five, we are going to build a decentralized application (DAPP) called Smart Contract Account Book for our project. The basic functions of our DAPP are one-to-one accounting, billing displaying and the transaction simplification, which can directly display the amount of money of one user owing to other users, and moreover provide a simplified approach for all the users to pay their debts in minimum number of transaction. This project is not only a practice of smart contract coding but also a practical application called Splitwise implemented on Ethereum based on decentralized concept.

## DAPP Function:

### One-to-one Accounting

**TO DO: ...**

### Billing Display

**TO DO: ...**

### Debt Simplification

**TO DO: ...**

## Run the Code

1. Compile smart contract: Add `mycontract.sol` to Remix - Ethereum IDE and compile.
2. Set up Ganache: Run `ganache-cli` in local terminal.
3. Deploy contract: At DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS interface, select Web3 Provider as environment and deploy the smart contract. Then copy the contract address/hash and change the `contractAddress` in script.js.
4. Interact with UI: Open `index.html` in any browser. Enjoy using our splitwise DAPP!
